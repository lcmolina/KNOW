    <b><h3>aspirational diversity</h3></b>
    <p>E-publishing provides the potential for a diverse set of voices to find wider circulation through opportunities to self-publish online. A DIY-ethos is one approach to e-publishing that takes place on a small, sometimes individual scale and creates one extreme when it comes to the spectrum of ways that e-publishing functions.<br><br> 
The other side to this coin is that through providing a greater number of access points, e-publishing creates increasingly homogeneous collections within libraries. E-publishing platforms create incentives for purchasing package subscriptions to journals and e-books. Libraries seeking to provide the greatest number of resources available have begun to increasingly focus on comprehensive collection building rather than focusing resources on a more limited scope of material resources. The result has been that library research collections increasingly look more and more like each other.<br><br> 
The theme of aspirational diversity takes into consideration the various ways we find diversity within libraries. Diversity of voices through authorship and diversity of materials through collection development policies are highlighted in the resources below as a starting point to begin thinking about what e-publishing can contribute or diminish when it comes to providing access to diverse knowledge and practices.

“Leaders of the profession fear that libraries will become obsolete if they do not abandon their traditional standards and goals and pursue the latest trends. But the reverse is true: The more libraries align their interests and values with their commercial partners, the less distinctive and indispensable they become.”
